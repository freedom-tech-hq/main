# Summary

freedom-opfs-syncable-store-backing implements a file/folder storage backend on top of the browserâ€™s OPFS, supporting creation, deletion, lookup, and metadata management for syncable items, and is designed to be used as the backing layer for higher-level syncable stores in the Freedom project.

# Overview

This package provides an implementation of a "SyncableStoreBacking" using the OPFS (Origin Private File System) API, which is a browser-based persistent file storage system.

Its main export is the OpfsSyncableStoreBacking class, which implements the SyncableStoreBacking interface.

The class manages a directory tree rooted at a FileSystemDirectoryHandle and provides methods to:
* Initialize the backing store with metadata.
* Check if an item exists at a given path.
* Retrieve files or folders at a given path.
* Create binary files and folders at specified paths, with conflict detection.
* Delete files or folders.
* Update local metadata for items.

All operations are asynchronous and return results wrapped in a custom async result type, with strong error typing (e.g., 'not-found', 'wrong-type', 'conflict').
