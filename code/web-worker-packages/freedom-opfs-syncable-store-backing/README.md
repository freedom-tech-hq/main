# freedom-opfs-syncable-store-backing

## Summary

freedom-opfs-syncable-store-backing implements a file/folder storage backend on top of the browserâ€™s OPFS (Origin Private File System), supporting creation, deletion, lookup, and metadata management for syncable items. It is designed to be used as the backing layer for higher-level syncable stores in the Freedom project.

## Overview

This package provides an implementation of a `SyncableStoreBacking` using the OPFS API, which is a browser-based persistent file storage system.

Its main export is the `OpfsSyncableStoreBacking` class, which implements the `SyncableStoreBacking` interface.

The class manages a directory tree rooted at a `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` and provides methods to:

- Initialize the backing store with metadata
- Check if an item exists at a given path
- Retrieve files or folders at a given path
- Create binary files and folders at specified paths, with conflict detection
- Delete files or folders
- Update local metadata for items

All operations are asynchronous and return results wrapped in a custom async result type, with strong error typing (e.g., `'not-found'`, `'wrong-type'`, `'conflict'`).

## Usage

This package is intended to be used as a low-level storage backend for syncable stores in the Freedom project. It abstracts direct interaction with the OPFS API, providing a higher-level interface for file and folder management with metadata and error handling.
