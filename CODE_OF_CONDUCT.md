# Contributor Code of Conduct

Welcome to the **Freedom** codebase. This project builds technology for freedom in the AI age. We expect all contributors to uphold a high standard of integrity, respect, and technical excellence.

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct outlines expectations for behavior in our development community and guides the enforcement process. Its goal is to ensure productive, inclusive, and truth-driven collaboration‚Äîwithout ideological policing.

## Ground Rules

### ‚úÖ Expected Behavior

- **Be Direct. Be Respectful.** Disagree with ideas, not people. We encourage radical candor‚Äîhonesty without hostility.
- **Focus on the Code.** Merit wins. Contributions are evaluated on technical value, not identity or ideology.
- **Protect Privacy.** Do not post personal information of others (e.g., doxing, screenshots from private spaces).
- **Use Secure Channels.** Report security issues privately via `security@FreedomTechHQ.com`.

### ‚ùå Unacceptable Behavior
