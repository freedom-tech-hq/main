- TS import needs .ts extension and cannot include dirs
- Use `exports.ts` instead of `index.ts` in lib packages. Use none of them in apps and backends
- Use `import type` for types
- Do not change tsconfig, do not install new ts runners or builders. TS toolkit is frozen
- Do not create d.ts files nor definitions, ask user to decide
- If user asks to capture knowledge, add it to '## AI Knowledge' of the relevant doc. Append the section if absent
- Project uses yarn workspaces and nx. Root is at /code/
- New tests follow AAA
- DO NOT catch errors unless asked explicitly. Never catch to log or replace text.
- Do not import files from other project packages like `import { X } from 'freedom-something/src/file.ts'`. Constrain to package and its 'exports' like `import { X } from 'freedom-something'`. Assume exports include what you need.

Follow patterns when relevant:

return makeFailure(
    new SomeError(trace, {
        message: '...',
        errorCode: 'conflict'
    })
);
SomeError is from code/cross-platform-packages/freedom-common-errors/src/types
