- **account** - A user entity in the Freedom ecosystem with its own identity and cryptographic keys. Accounts can create and access stores based on permissions. See [User-Facing File System](User-Facing%20File%20System.md)

- **store** = **root** - The top-level container for encrypted, synchronized data. Each store has one creator account and can be shared with other accounts. A single account can own multiple stores. See [User-Facing File System](User-Facing%20File%20System.md)

- **origin** - Metadata that proves who created an item in the store. Contains an author-signed hash of the path and contents, establishing verifiable creation attribution. See [Permission Management](Permission%20Management.md)

- **acceptance** - A validation signature from a high-trust user (creator/owner/admin) confirming that an item or change is approved. Items with acceptance can skip certain validation checks. See [Permission Management](Permission%20Management.md)

- **provenance** - Combined metadata establishing both origin (who created an item) and acceptance status (if approved by a trusted user). Used for validation during synchronization. See [Permission Management](Permission%20Management.md)

- **ID** (file system) - Unique identifiers for folders, bundles, and files in the store. Come in three variants:
  - **plain ID** - Unencrypted identifiers used for system files where the name doesn't reveal sensitive information
  - **encrypted ID** - Default for most files, encrypted using the same mechanism as file data to prevent metadata leakage
  - **time-based ID** - Composed of an ISO timestamp and UUID, used when time-ordered processing is important
  See  [File System Encryption](File%20System%20Encryption.md)

- **folder** - A container object that can hold other folders, bundles, and files. Each folder is independently sharable and has its own access control. See [User-Facing File System](User-Facing%20File%20System.md)

- **bundle** - A container object that can hold other bundles and files (but not folders). Unlike folders, bundles inherit permissions from their parent folder. See [User-Facing File System](User-Facing%20File%20System.md)

- **(flat) file** - Contains binary data. Files are immutable and inherit permissions from their parent folder. See [User-Facing File System](User-Facing%20File%20System.md)

- **remotes** - External systems that store and synchronize data, typically Freedom Cloud or Freedom Nodes. Users configure which remotes to use for each store. See [Synchronization](Synchronization.md)

- **CRDT** (Conflict-free Resolution Data Type) - Data structures that can be updated independently and concurrently without coordination, with automatic conflict resolution. Used for access control documents and other potentially conflicting data. See [CRDT](CRDT.md)

- **signed token** - Timestamped data signed with a user's private signing key, used for authentication when accessing remotes. Tokens are validated against access control documents. See [Synchronization](Synchronization.md)

- **.access-control bundle** - Special bundle containing role/access information and encrypted shared keys. Not fully encrypted to allow for basic access checks. See [Permission Management](Permission%20Management.md)

- **.changes bundle** - Special bundle containing information about deleted items. See [User-Facing File System](User-Facing%20File%20System.md)

- **trusted time name** - Time-based ID generated by a trusted time source. Used for access control changes to ensure proper ordering. Store creators can generate these offline; other users need to be online. See [Synchronization](Synchronization.md)

- **shared key set** - Collection of encryption keys shared among users with read access. Contains mapped user public key IDs to encrypted secret keys. See [File System Encryption](File%20System%20Encryption.md)

- **Freedom Node** - Personal server that can sync with user devices and Freedom Cloud. Can have varying levels of access to user data depending on key sharing. See [Synchronization](Synchronization.md)

- **Freedom Cloud** - Central storage service for Freedom data. Has access to encrypted data but cannot decrypt it. See [Synchronization](Synchronization.md)

- **user profile allocation** - Process where a user device pushes profile data to configured remotes to establish initial access. See [Synchronization](Synchronization.md)

- **root allocation** - Initial push from a user device to a Node for a root folder, enabling the Node to start syncing with other systems. See [Synchronization](Synchronization.md)
