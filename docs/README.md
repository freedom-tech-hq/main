# Freedom Documentation

Welcome to the Freedom docs! This guide helps you navigate our documentation structure.

## What's Where

### Top-Level Folders

* **Architecture/** - System design, component relationships, and technical decisions
* **Processes/** - Business-process guidelines. Written for both people and AI-agents
* **\[Feature Name]/** - Documentation for a specific feature
  * [**Store**](<Store/README.md>) - Encrypted synchronized file store, the core of our system
  * **Email** - Encrypted email service

### Key Documents

* [**/How to Write Good Docs.md**](<How to Write Good Docs.md>) - Guidelines for contributing to documentation
* **\[Feature Name]/! Start Here.md** - Noticeable entry point, organized links to other docs
* **\[Feature Name]/! FUNCTIONAL COVERAGE.md** - Test planning and coverage tracking

## How to Work With `/docs`
